            <p>One of the key features of Axios is its ability to intercept HTTP 
                requests. HTTP interceptors come in handy when you need to examine or 
                change HTTP requests from your application to the server or 
                vice versa (e.g., logging, authentication, or retrying a failed HTTP 
                request).
